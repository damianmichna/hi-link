# **Hi-Link**
Documents related to Hi-Link Electronic products

## **Objective**
This repository aims to provide information about various **Hi-Link** products.

For the products that I have personally tested, I am working on creating **detailed and comprehensive documentation**.

For untested products, I plan to **compile a list of official manufacturer resources** along with relevant external sources available on the internet.

## **Current Focus: HLK-LD2420**
I am currently focusing on the **HLK-LD2420**, a 24GHz human body micro-motion sensing detection radar sensor module. This device is capable of detecting human presence and motion with high precision, making it suitable for applications such as security systems, smart lighting, and occupancy monitoring.

### **Serial Protocol Analysis**
An **initial version of the serial protocol documentation** for the HLK-LD2420 is available in this repository. This analysis provides insights into the communication protocol used by the device, facilitating integration and customization efforts.

### **Features of HLK-LD2420**
- **High Sensitivity:** Capable of detecting subtle human movements.
- **Wide Detection Range:** Effective over a considerable area, suitable for various applications.
- **Compact Design:** Easy to integrate into existing systems due to its small form factor.
- **Low Power Consumption:** Energy-efficient, ideal for battery-powered applications.

For more detailed information, please refer to the documentation provided in the repository.

Enjoy & have fun!
